# Renaissance-canons
Media for the author's paper "Renaissance canons with asymmetric schemes," including the new compositions ["Kyrie on a Fibonacci scheme"](12_fib_Kyrie_novel_canon__.mp3) and ["Benedictus on a Sicut Cervus scheme"](16-17_SC_Benedictus_novel_canon__.mp3).

Each filename begins with a number that indicates the number of the corresponding figure in the text. There are two new canons in Renaissance style using unexplored schemes. The other files are either extracts from the 16th-century repertoire or short examples composed to illustrate points in the text. These files will be linked to the scores in the paper upon publication.

In addition, we provide a [Sage program](Canon_flexibility_calculator.sage), which was used to compute some numerical data in the paper.
